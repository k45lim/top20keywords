# top20keywords
Helps job hunters to list down the keywords of any job posting in order to customize their resume

Name of the program: Wordcount.py

Installation: Copy Wordcount.py, excluded_words.csv and POSTING.TXT all in one folder.

How to use: 
1. Get to a website and copy all the text in the job posting.
2. Open POSTING.TXT and paste all the text in this file.  Take note, if there is an existing content, delete the content first before pasting the text from step 1.
3. Save and close POSTING.TXT
4. Open a command prompt and go to the folder where you copied all these files.
5. Once in the folder, run the prompt :  python Wordcount.py
6. You should see the top 20 keywords as output. For complete list of words, open the file wordcounts.txt
7. The algorithm uses TagCrowd as it specs.
